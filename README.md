Description:

This repository contains the Python software for two of the options assigned for Homework #2.  The Python code is intended to be 
executed on a Windows based computing platform.  Each program for the options PyBank and PyPoll are called main.py.  
The input files required by the software needs to be in a subdirectory called “RawData” below the directory of where the main 
program is executing.  The programs write files to the same directory as the main program.
